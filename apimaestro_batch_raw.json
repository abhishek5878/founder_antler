      "about": "Leading a quiet rebellion in construction leadership.\n\nAfter 11+ years in heavy civil construction, running crews, managing high-pressure jobs, and learning things the hard way, I\u2019ve noticed something:\n\nMost leadership training has no business in construction.\n\nIt\u2019s corporate. \nTheoretical.\n\nIt sounds good in a boardroom but falls flat on a muddy jobsite.\n\nWe teach people how to lay pipe, pour concrete, and operate machinery.\n\nBut when it comes to motivating a crew, creating a culture of accountability, or leading under pressure?\n\nMost leaders are left to figure it out on their own. \n\nTrial by fire.\n\nAnd that gap shows up in all the usual ways:\n\n- Delays and rework from poor communication\n- Stunted productivity and burnout\n- Good people walking off the job for good\n\nI\u2019m not claiming to have it all figured out.\nBut I am building something practical:\n\nA leadership system shaped by real crews, real pressure, and real mistakes.\n\nNot theory. \nNot fluff. \nJust tools that work where you work.\n\nIf you\u2019re a foreman, superintendent, project manager, or anyone leading people in the industry: this is for you.\n\nMore to come (stay tuned)...\n\n- - - \n\nIn the meantime, here's how you can stay in the loop:\n\n1. FOLLOW ME for daily insights on leading teams in construction. Lessons, stories, and the odd bit of cheekiness - all real, straight from the field.\n\n2. SUBSCRIBE to The Leadership Blueprint newsletter, trusted by industry pros. I share one actionable insider tip a week:\n\nleadershipblueprint.substack.com\n\n3. REACH OUT directly! I\u2019m always open to connect or talk shop:\n\n\ud83d\udce9 tariq.shobab@gmail.com \n\nLet\u2019s build better leaders together.",

Fourteen years later, I proudly serve as the CEO of this Bengaluru-based web application development company. My expertise spans various web development frameworks, but my true passion and proficiency lie in product management and product ownership.\n\nThroughout my career, I have spearheaded significant projects that have made substantial impacts. Notably, I developed a property tax collection portal for a state government mission, facilitating the collection of over INR 1600 Million annually. I have also been at the helm of creating a CMS-CRM solution for a pioneering company in the aviation sector and played a crucial role in developing an MVP for a then-emerging bike rental startup, which has now become a market leader. My contributions have extended to the ed-tech sector, where I successfully guided a startup through its launch phase.\n\nA committed agilist since 2016, I hold certifications from Scrum.org. My strength lies in my deep-rooted ability to dissect and understand the essence of a problem. This skill has been honed through my experiences as a first-generation entrepreneur, where problem-solving has not just been a necessity but a way of life.",

      "about": "I started my career developing algorithms for optimizing the design of aircraft. Through this, I developed expertise in solving complex nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (Navier Stokes, Structural Dynamics), Optimization, developing high-performance computational algorithms, and writing software to solve these complex problems across millions of data points (FORTRAN, C++, Python, MPI, OpenMP, etc.) I've presented at several high-impact conferences.\n\nThe next part of my career was in Corporate Research and Software Development across the Aerospace and Automotive industries. I wrote proposals to obtain funding (up to USD 700K from NASA and the US DoD). I worked in multi-national and multi-cultural teams. I also managed a research relationship with a remotely located team. Through this phase, I developed strength in managing the execution of corporate research projects.\n\nSince 2013, I've bootstrapped a business in education consulting. I helped hundreds of Indian candidates get into global top-20 MBA programs  - including Harvard Business School, MIT, Kellogg, London Business School, INSEAD, ISB, and IIM-Ahmedabad. I coached and mentored about 40 students every year (Engineers from IITs, NITs, and other top-tier Indian colleges, CA's, and other professionals). My students secured an average of US $1.2 Million in scholarships yearly.\n\nFrom the business point of view, we've had several firsts:\n\n1. Usage of AI and Automation to accelerate work processes (including marketing, sales, financial processes, customer onboarding, appointment scheduling, and project management) in a high-pressure, time-bound, and consultant-time-intensive industry.\n2. First to set up an online course platform.\n3. First to introduce an ultra-low-cost and distributed consulting model.\n4. We are one of the highest-rated Indian consulting firms on GMATclub and Poets and Quants - which are very popular forums amongst MBA applicants.\n\nThis resulted in August Academy having healthy profit margins and YoY revenue growth.\n\nI'm now looking to work on intellectually challenging data science problems (Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence) that have the potential to create Scientific and Business Impact.",

Initially, I was somewhat forced by life to come back to my hometown but with time I realized that there is a lot to learn and grow everywhere. Our family is a joint family and we run a few privately held small businesses. The roles and responsibilities are not very clearly defined but with time things evolve and any new entrant gets his role. I worked in accounts of all the businesses and operations of our Medical Store. \n\nI learned some basics about business and how money flows. I also learned about how companies operate at ground level in the fields of FMCG, Medicine, Mobiles and alike. I used to be reluctant to meeting new people and talking about business. Now I am more confident and poised in initiating conversations and understanding businesses. ",

We don\u2019t sell products. We sell moods, the kind you want to relive. Each drop is part feeling, part fantasy, part escape. People don\u2019t just buy in, they feel seen.\nI\u2019ve made films, hosted festivals, and built a relief network from my bedroom during lockdown. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was real. And it taught me that if you want people to remember something, you have to make them feel it.\nAt GlassEye, I served as Vice President, produced 15+ short films, hosted Reverie (our flagship film festival) with its highest-ever turnout, and partnered with sponsors to amplify our work across Delhi NCR. I\u2019ve also worked in marketing strategy at OneXtel (where I was called back as a consultant), and volunteered with nonprofits like Unmukti and The Leaf Society, using digital tools to help optimise outreach.\nI\u2019ve represented my school in swimming competitively, and studied Mathematics with a minor in English at the University of Delhi, which means I can write a poem about calculus, and also solve for x.\nI\u2019m currently exploring global opportunities in brand strategy, experience design, and emotion-led marketing, with the long-term goal of building brands that people feel, not just follow.",

      "about": "I am Sharan Hegde, better known as Finance With Sharan.  Actively looking for super smart people to work with me- superdm.com/sharan\n\nWith 3.5 million+ subscribers on YouTube and 2.7 million followers on Instagram - you must have seen my entertaining finance videos pop up in your feed, but my LinkedIn is going to tell you a different story. Here I will share my entrepreneurial stories.\n\nWith a team of 100+ people, I am going to build my start-up \u20181% Club\u2019 in public.\n\nBut before I tell you more, here is a little backstory\n\nIt started during my school days when I could not make it to my dream IIT (average Indian household story). That setback made me fiercely competitive. I carried that energy for the next few years of my life.\n\nFast forward to 2019, I picked up another goal of securing a promotion at my job as a management consultant. Without this promotion, MBA application would look bad. Two years of pure hard work and grind led to a massive 5% increment in salary with no promotion. \n\nThere you go, setback number 2.\n\nNext, I attempted CAT 2021 with the aim of IIM Bangalore in my heart, and if you didn\u2019t see it coming already, this was setback number 3.\n\nI'm sure my story resonates with millions of you guys. So what did I do next? I wrapped up all these learnings, treated failures as feedback, and evolved in an unconventional manner. This is how Finance With Sharan was born.\n\nMy mission to spread financial literacy and make it fun for others saw growth in leaps and bounds. Over the last 3 years, I have realized that there is a need to make finance simple and effective, and that is exactly what I am here to do.\n\nAround 2 years back I started The 1% Club. an exclusive members-only community to help people achieve financial independence and become the top 1%. Financial independence is a superpower to never be controlled by money. Less than 1% of people can achieve in their lifetime. Even Kaun Banega Crorepati winners end up bankrupt. Clearly, there is a massive need for us to learn what our schools never taught us and The 1% Club is the solution to this problem.",

In the following 24 months, we achieved what we hadn't been able to do in the previous 3 years. We grew revenues to over \u00a35million in ARR and now promote card-linked offers to over 105 million payment cards globally, via partnerships with major financial institutions, airlines, employee benefit platforms and reward schemes. \n\nWe are building market-leading rewards scheme technology and solutions. \nB2B focussed. Technology driven. \n\nWe also raised multi-seven-figure investment to fund our growth. \n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nAchievements:\n- RMI 30under30 (Restaurant Marketer & Innovator)\n- Hurun's Future Stars\n- Top 42 entrepreneurs under 42 by Insider SW\n- Multi-seven-figure in equity investment secured throughout the lifetime of the business\n- Top Ten Entrepreneurs to Watch in 2017 by #1 Global University Accelerator, SETsquared\n- Two time Bath Business Plan competition winner & UoB Dragons' Den winner\n- Sparkies Awards: Finalist of the Best App category and James Courtney for FutureSpark award\n- Creative Bath Awards: Finalist in the Best App category and James Courtney for Young Creative\n- Ten months at IBM working on Social Media Analytics & engaging with innovation days\n- Six months at Unilever working on Global Marketing Strategy\n- A summer at PwC as a Management Consultant\n- A year at Filament as an AI Strategist (product mgmt, strategy consulting & marketing)\n- Graduated with a First in BSc.

Using his experience as a management consultant for IBM and PwC, he spotted a gap in the restaurant promotion market for a premium alternative to discounting. He led the business through multiple equity funding rounds, totalling seven-figures and including investment from JUST EAT Plc.\n\nPost-covid, he pivoted the business into the B2B space. This moved LUX away from being a consumer app and now focusses on working in partnership with major airlines and banks. This strategic shift has transformed the business, with revenue growing by over 100x in a 2 year period.",

As a member of the investment team, I participated on investment calls, onsite and offsite meetings with leading fund managers and investment analysts, extensive internal discussion and debate regarding some of the world's most well known, established and sometimes even emerging Hedge Funds, across equity, activism, specialist credit, macro and a variety of other niche strategies such as structured credit, stat-arb, merger-arb, short-bias, volatility, commodity and industry specialists.\n\nMy role as part of the investment team sat within investment risk and was to focus on risk adjusted performance for invested and prospective funds. Blow up risk, jump risk, market risk, liquidity constraints, were all part of the analysis which fed through to monthly asset allocation and sizing decisions. Much of the work I did looked at whether our managers were appropriately being paid for the risk they were taking, relative to other opportunities which were visible to us in the marketplace. This was an exciting opportunity to decompose leading hedge fund trading strategies to understand the drivers of risk, return and manager thought process behind some of the most exciting, dynamic and best performing global hedge fund's which we were invested in, using position transparency, where available to decompose trades. Decisions were made by marrying our bottom up analysis with our top down macro views of the world.\n\nI engaged with a number of markets and regions, as well as leading industry professionals across the Hedge Fund and Investment Management landscape from London to the USA and Far East, many of whom I continue to remain connected with.",

      "about": "I act as creative director and founder of Company Policy where we specialize in creating and building  brands through crafting visual identities and narratives helping companies build, grow and evolve. We build timeless brands by not chasing visual appeal and style, but rather honing the full communication of a brand to make sure it is looking, talking and feeling like itself. \n\nWe partner with leaders and founders who are invested \u2028and involved, who want to create or do what\u2019s next not what\u2019s been done, and who are obsessed with quality and innovation. We\u2019ve embedded with teams and worked directly with founders.\n\nI'm a former teacher who taught at The School of Visual Arts MFA and BFA programs as well as at Cornell Tech MBA program. I'm passionate about design education and harnessing the creative process.\n\nSadly, I'm not related to Alex Katz or Katz's Deli and I own two dogs no cats. If you\u2019re looking for thoughtful design say hello@companypolicy.studio",

      "about": "What if your computer could work independently, just like a human assistant?\n\nAfter a decade in AI research at Google DeepMind, something still deeply puzzled me: we spend 2.5 hours daily just moving our computer mouse. That's 30% of our work time on mechanical tasks.\n\nThis realization led me to build Simular AI. We're creating AI agents that use computers like humans do - clicking, typing, and navigating interfaces - so you can focus on what truly matters.\n\nMy journey spans:\n\n- Research: 39 papers in top AI venues (NeurIPS, ICML, CVPR, ICLR)\n- Engineering: Scaled AI systems at Google (Ads, Maps, YouTube)\n- Leadership: Built & led teams in autonomous driving\n- Competition: 2x World Finalist in ACM/ICPC\n\nNow, I'm on a mission to democratize AI assistance. Because the future of work isn't about replacing humans - it's about augmenting them.\n\nWant to see the future of human-computer interaction?\n\u2192 Visit simular.ai\n\u2192 Follow my insights on X @angli_ai",

I realized I had a knack for spotting inefficiencies and solving problems in novel ways.\n\nThat\u2019s why I got into tech, and now I've been working in this industry for over a decade (ok almost 2 decades).\n\nI\u2019ve led 3 successful exits, scaled 3 businesses to $100M ARR, and led teams to develop innovative solutions that save companies millions in operational costs.\n\nToday, I'm building something new (currently in stealth). \n\nFollow my profile if you want to see what's next.\n\nYou\u2019ll also find me here sharing thoughts on startup culture, turnarounds, leadership, and my daily rants about life and business\u2014unfiltered, no fluff, just the hard truths and lessons I\u2019ve learned along the way.\u270c\ufe0f",

Love helping outlier entrepreneurs build disruptive companies and valuable communities in large markets (e.g., FalconX, Habi, Noetica AI, OpenFX, TopLine Pro, ZestAI).  I've seen the movie a few times as an entrepreneur -- Upromise Co-Founder, President/COO (acquired by NASDAQ: SLM) and Open Market (NASDAQ: OMKT) VP Marketing and Business Development -- and enjoy helping others avoid the many mistakes I've made. Also co-founded LEADS (exec ed program for civic and business leaders from gateway cities), and serve on the board of Facing History (educational nonprofit combating antisemitism and racism).",

      "about": "As a board certified behavior analyst, author, and leading children\u2019s sleep consultant, I know that every great journey starts with a good night's sleep. I founded Percy to revolutionize how families and healthcare providers use behavioral data to create lasting and transformative change in this vital area of our lives.\n\nFrom my background as an Intelligence Officer and Major in the US Air Force, to my lived experience as mother of four children, I bring focus and stamina to solving problems. My MS in Behavioral Psychology and board certification as a BCBA inform a rigorous and evidence-based approach to sleep behavior change. And my MBA from Kellogg has helped me translate my unique perspective and expertise into a market-changing business proposition.\n\nFor much of the last two decades, I\u2019ve run a pioneering sleep consultancy, Dream Team Baby, with my business partner, Kira Ryan. Together, we launched the first overnight sleep consultancy in Manhattan\u2013an offering that paved the way for what has become a $40M sleep consultant industry. Our work was featured in major media outlets including The Today Show, Good Morning America, and Nightline, The CBS Early Show, ParentsTV, Washingtonian Magazine, American Baby, Fatherly, and New York Family, among others. Our book, The Dream Sleeper: A Three-Part Plan for Getting Your Baby to Love Sleep (Jossey-Bass, Inc., 2012) documents our methodology and helps parents and children form healthy sleep behaviors, which leads to a love of sleep. \n\nWith the launch of Percy, I\u2019m bringing the full scope of my experience to the table to create a new dawn in sleep technology. We are still in stealth-mode, but will provide updates as we refine our product. Please join our journey at percysleep.com.",

      "about": "David is an entrepreneur and tech industry leader who founded and currently leads Hayle Inc.\n\nIn August 2018, Hayle launched a mobile social networking application enabling users to connect with local people based on their shared interests. Unlike other social media platforms, Hayle is focused on creating meaningful connections and addressing the problem of social isolation. David and his team worked tirelessly to refine and improve the application, testing various iterations in different cities, until they found the perfect formula to create stronger friendships and healthier relationships.\n\nAfter leaving Hayle in October 2018 to better understand the tech industry in California, David returned to Ottawa in December 2018. He quickly identified the growing demand for home renovations and the potential for technology to support this trend. In January 2019, David began exploring opportunities in the stone industry, working with a granite and marble distribution company and witnessing the potential for technology solutions in this space.\n\nIn April 2020, David formed a joint partnership with TSF - The Stone Fabricator Inc., a countertop fabrication company, to leverage the latest web technologies to assist the growing demand for home renovations. David played a key role in redesigning and developing TSF's website into a sophisticated web application, complete with a customer relationship management system, online inventory, and loyalty program to entice B2B customers.\n\nAfter rejoining Hayle in April 2021 as Chief Executive Officer, David led a complete rebranding of the company, detaching the name \"Hayle\" from the mobile application and establishing it as their official business name. Due to the pandemic, he pivoted the company towards creative services, designing and developing web applications, mobile applications, and software for various industries and government bodies.\n\nIn October 2022, David launched a new project called StoneForge by Hayle Inc., a web application for stone fabricators to manage their business from A to Z. David's experience, vision, and expertise in developing technology solutions have enabled him to create innovative solutions that drive measurable business outcomes and help his clients stay ahead of the curve in a rapidly changing digital landscape.",

He contributed to efforts around youth homelessness, including support for bill proposals aimed at improving access to federal funding, transitional housing, and education programs for at-risk youth.\n\nHe fostered national conversations around Basic Income, advocating for a model inspired by the Ontario Basic Income Pilot\u2014where Canadians earning under $40,000 annually receive direct support, and those earning above $120,000 contribute more. David also took a firm public stance against Bill C-51, championing civil liberties and rallying communities concerned with government overreach and surveillance.\n\nBeyond policy work, David has been a visible advocate in media and public events. He has spoken at University of Ottawa guest lectures, and appeared on Global News, CBC, CTV, and WE Day, sharing his insights and experiences to raise awareness on homeless youth, Indigenous equity, and social justice.\n\nDavid\u2019s advocacy extended to Indigenous communities, particularly the Cree in Quebec, where he championed clean water access and the development of trades-based education programs to foster long-term opportunity. His journey and impact were also featured in a TEDx talk, where he reflected on the power of policy, public voice, and inclusive change.",

In 2020, I embarked on the right path, focusing on product development, team building, and streamlining production, while also learning the ins and outs of running a business.\n\nOne quote that resonates deeply with me is \"Work hard in Silence, let your success do the talking.\" \n\nI believe that success speaks for itself, and I strive to achieve my goals with dedication & hard work, rather than seeking attention or praise.",

In 2008 I switched over to A Hundred Monkeys to be the Strategy Director. In 2013 I was promoted to Creative Director. \n\nI've worked on hundreds of naming and branding projects for Fortune 50 companies and neighborhood bars.\n\nI've been featured in NPR, The New York Times, Monocle, and The Wall Street Journal for naming and branding pieces. In 2014, my naming book, Don't Call It That, was published by Extracurricular Press and became an Amazon best-seller. In 2018 I released my second book, Run Studio Run, a guide to running small creative studios. \n\nIf you're working on something interesting, I'd love to hear from you.",

Since studying Materials Science at Stanford, I\u2019ve been working on a new biotech venture to revolutionize the way that we take medicine. \n\nGrowing up, I always loved dreaming about novel technologies but I didn\u2019t see myself as a scientist. I was incredibly fortunate to find mentors once at Stanford that led me down this path. The whole time, I've been focused mostly on two areas - health and climate - as both allow me to channel technology into improving people\u2019s lives. \n\nFor now though, I\u2019m wholeheartedly focused on how we can re-design pharmaceutical products and our relationship to health. I believe that taking a holistic approach, and taking responsibility for the user experience and design of each element of what we build is necessary to create real change. \n\nFeel free to reach out to me to discuss anything materials / nano science / biotech, healthcare, or women in STEM.",

My work centers on building scalable, impactful solutions that improve patient outcomes, support healthcare professionals, and modernize the care ecosystem. \n\nMy journey began after seeing the effects of misdiagnosis within my own family, an experience that led to a lifelong mission to make healthcare safer, smarter, and more humane. That mission guided me from founding and selling an AI startup to now shaping strategic growth efforts at the intersection of AI, data, and healthcare innovation.\n\nOur focus is global. Our approach is collaborative. And our vision is bold: a healthcare system where technology works for everyone: patients, providers, and innovators alike. \n\nLet\u2019s connect if you're working on something that can change the world, or if you want to be part of one that is.",

I thrive in fast-paced environments with high standards and in roles that require constant learning, creative thinking, leadership, and action. \n\nI\u2019m personally and professionally interested in Climate Change, the Future of Work, Healthcare, and how advances in LLMs and other AI systems can help us build a cleaner, healthier world for the generations that come after us.\n\nSome of the things I love doing and am really good at:\n- Figuring out how to get from 0 to 1 on new ideas and thinking critically about the \u201cWhys?\u201d\n- Crafting a meaningful vision to attract talented people and align our efforts\n- Creating high-performing, psychologically safe environments for superstars to collaborate and do  their best work in\n- Being a servant / egoless leader\n- Working alongside the team as a peer in whatever capacity is most needed (this gives me energy)\n\nThe thread throughout my career has been using technology to solve problems, with a particular interest in applied ML/AI. I think some of my most formative experiences were as an end user of state-of-the-art AI systems at Amazon a decade ago, seeing how profoundly applied ML can create competitive advantages. \n\nFor the next part of my career, I\u2019m dedicating myself to using emerging AI technologies to solve pressing problems in the Jobs, Climate, Financial, and Healthcare spaces.",

      "about": "ChannelCore started as a marketing agency, built to help brands scale profitably. But after working closely with both content creators and brands, it became clear there was a bigger opportunity, to build the infrastructure the creator economy truly needs.\n\nThat\u2019s why ChannelCore is evolving to a tech platform designed to help content creators run their businesses like businesses - scalable, profitable, and built for the long term.\n\nMy journey to this point has been anything but traditional. I started as a music teacher and later became a touring musician, where I learned the power of creativity, discipline, and connection. Those experiences taught me how to perform under pressure, adapt quickly, and lead with purpose.\n\nWhen I transitioned into marketing, I quickly made an impact leading teams, driving revenue growth, and building scalable systems. I rose through the ranks to become a 2x CMO, leading marketing strategies that scaled brands from $1.5M to $6M, $16M to $31M, $64M to $200M, and even $750M to $1.2B. In 2024, I was recognized as a CMO to Watch by the CMO Alliance, a testament to the results-driven approach and leadership style that define my career.\n\nOver the last 17 years, I\u2019ve led, built, and scaled marketing teams of 30+, managed $75M+ in ad spend, and owned full P&L responsibility all focused on profitable, sustainable growth.\n\nMy work spans global brands and fast-growing startups, with results like:\n\n\u2022 Luxury Fashion Brand: Scaled to a successful exit\n\n\u2022 DTC Apparel: 4.5X ROAS while reducing CAC by 38%\n\n\u2022 CPG Brand: Tripled new customer revenue, boosted LTV by 60%\n\n\u2022 Fintech Startup: Increased lead conversion by 240%, reduced CPA by 45%\n\n\u2022 Financial Services Firm: Built a scalable customer acquisition strategy that doubled inbound leads\n\nNow, with ChannelCore\u2019s evolution, we\u2019re building something bigger designed for the next generation of content creators and brands ready to scale.\n\n\u26a1Check out more at https://channelcore.io\n\nMore soon.",

      "about": "Helping my mom recover from a heart attack years ago  opened my eyes to how truly disconnected and fragmented our health care system is. Even after years of working in the health care industry, I still felt frustrated. There was no advocate to coordinate care for her \u2013 we didn\u2019t know what to do, or the kind of specialists and medications she needed during her recovery. I realized there's got to be a better way for my mom and for all the moms and dads out there.\n\nThat personal experience led me to my calling \u2013 to help seniors get the kind of care and support they need and deserve. That\u2019s why we founded Alignment Health. \n\nToday, we are aiming to set a new, innovative standard in health care delivery, shifting the focus of health care from payments to people. With 10,000 adults turning 65 every day, the need to ensure our seniors receive the best care is greater than ever.",

Authored the virtues. Drafted the company manifesto. Designed the operating philosophies. Handled all employee relations and people operations. Served as the voice of the company and fostered the early culture. Doubled as the Chief People Officer. Played a not-so-little part in a ton of other pivotal moments that were not glamorous and likely won't be remembered. Earned a reputation, and the respect from employees, for being a kind and brave leader who cared greatly for the mission, the team, and the business.

These experiences provided me with a solid foundation in data analysis and technology development.\n\nPrior to establishing Xenesis, I worked at the Official Airline Guide, focusing on commercializing global aviation datasets. During this time, I envisioned a global flight tracking solution that utilized satellite technology to modernize flight tracking systems. Recognizing the critical nature and volume of data involved, I shifted my focus from data creation to developing the world's first commercial optical data transport provider. This led to the founding of Xenesis, where we pioneered the delivery of a global optical multilayered mesh network system. Having exited Xenesis ...

During another period, I educated other software engineers concerning I18N and worked on internationalizing software at several consecutive software companies (a BIOS developer, a genetic science startup, a company making an Enterprise database abstraction layer, an advisor to 3rd party Bay-Area software developers, a German company developing a time-tracking system, and a few others).\n\nI have also brought three products to market myself (and with some contractors).  I'm currently working on the fourth.product.  I did the Full Stage Life-cycle development, marketing, and sales.\n\nI feel very experienced, because I have seen so much software in different stages of development. I identify design or testing weaknesses, implementation or benchmark issues, and address those problems.  I talk constructively with involved engineers and management, and give good presentations.\n\nI have led several terms, one for NCR Micrographics, and for my own products.\n\nBecause of all of this technical exposure and the skill I've gained in the navigation of people and personalities to accomplish different projects, I am seeking a company which needs an experienced, stabilizing manager to successfully create, finish, and deliver great products, mentor employees, and use appropriate methodologies and metrics.  I am committed to your success.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nPortfolio and some code at MLSchaffer.com  Like all good websites, it is under constant improvement and is a work in progress.",

      "about": "I had a DREAM. Growing up I always wanted to be in marketing. My imagination was boundless and I was considered a creative student by my teachers. As destiny was to have it, my tracks changed. Few years from then, I was in an engineering school where tech became my life. From one competition to another, I raked up a few Tech awards and prizes. So much so that I went on to completing my Masters in engineering. Just as I was starting to have an amazing career, destiny reversed gears again. \n\nEnter AMERICAS in my life. All of a sudden I was a stranger in a new land, the land of opportunities. Guess what? I didn't even have conversational English skills. As with any immigrant, we think in our mother tongue and convert it into English before talking. On top of it, I graduated from MBA and was unemployed for 9 months. After initial struggles, I took up a sales job that built my conversational English skills and confidence. \n\nSoon I was in the most fascinating job ever - an intimate lingerie salesman. I loved the job and people were amazing. They came to know about my Tech background and asked me to create an e-commerce website for them. I was able to deliver a user centric high design eCommerce website and a viral digital growth strategy. Once I hit the ball out of the park, I knew I was built for Tech + Marketing. That's where it all started, HonestAI by GrayCyan.\n\nAt HAI-GC, we build AI and App Tech that goes VIRAL. We have generated $51 Mn for 550+ brands in the last 7 years. Clients love us for our generosity and helping them build and viral their technology/apps/AI.\n\nIf you have an AI project or an tech idea, DM me or book a call (link in bio\u261d\ufe0f). Would love build your Tech. Open but selective to equity deals.\n\nI am also the Editor-in-Chief at HonestAI, where are publish monthly AI thought leadership.

We worked with world class organizations like CVS/Aetna, Cigna, & Blue Cross Blue Shield, & Oscar to level up their data standards. I am still an active board member and advisor to 1up.\n\nIn 2023 I started GenHealth.ai where we have built the worlds first Large Medical Model. Our model beats other commercially available models by 14%+ in predicting next years cost of care. In addition we're building an AI Copilot to increase prior auth and medical order processing times by over 200%.",

For me, it\u2019s about more than buying or selling homes \u2014 it\u2019s about guiding people through one of the most meaningful decisions of their lives with trust, care, and honesty.\n\nI believe relationships matter more than transactions. Whether I was helping a beauty client or teaching a new lash artist, or now helping someone find a home, I bring the same values: connection, empowerment, and integrity.\n\nI\u2019m currently preparing to earn my real estate license and building my network in the Greater Boston & Central MA markets.

She was often challenged to find creative solutions to provide non-traditional financing for her clients. As a result, she developed a marketing plan to strategically grow the number of minority clients in the department (specifically African American). Prior to her outreach, there were no African American clients out of a total client base of approximately 2,500. Her efforts were hugely successful resulting in an increase of 25 African American clients in six months and the marketing plan was adopted by senior management to increase the number of minority clients including Asians and Hispanics. \n\nMs. Curry\u2019s efforts and success in the minority communities led to her appointment as the Relationship Manager for the Tennessee Titans \u2013 NFL and Nashville Predators \u2013 NHL. She developed impactful financial wellness and awareness programs for both teams along with services such as Bill Paying where a department was formed to pay the bills of both NFL and NHL players. Both programs were a huge success for the client and bank and still exist today. Sustainability of programs is always a leading goal.",

She gained her position by being one of nine individuals (out of 350) to be selected as a participant in a new program to train a \u201cnew breed\u201d of investment advisors. After successfully completing the program and scoring the highest on the Series 7, she was assigned a territory in rural West Tennessee. Ms. Curry developed a strategic plan and marketing program that entailed putting her \u201cboots on the ground\u201d at every branch location in her territory and building relationships with branch managers. This strategy led to the region becoming one of the top territories for the bank.   \n\nOther advisors adopted her plan and were equally successful. Additionally, due to her knowledge about investing, she began to share investment strategies with family and others in the low- and mid-income communities. Her passion to educate individuals on how to build wealth was born while serving in this role. Ms. Curry learned very quickly the power of investing and taking a long-term view to building wealth. Today she continues to add to the number of people in which she has made an impact, some reaching millionaire status because of her sound counsel. Career highlights include: managed more than $75 million in investable assets; earned her Series 7 and Series 6 certifications and Health & Life Insurance licenses.",

Personal MBA Coach was founded in 2008 to offer a boutique and personalized level of application support unavailable at other firms. Our approach is unique and, unlike with many other consultancies, you will not be handed off to a junior consultant who works with a few clients a year and has limited insight into the application process. All Personal MBA Coach clients work directly with our founder, Scott Edinburgh or a former M7 admissions director. This means you work directly with an expert throughout the entire process. \n\nPersonal MBA Coach helps clients with all aspects of the MBA application process including early planning, GMAT/GRE/EA tutoring, application strategy, school selection, essay editing, and mock interviews. Our team includes former M7 admissions directors and former M7 admissions interviewers. We work with a select number of applicants each year and place them into the best MBA, EMBA, part-time MBA and other graduate school programs.\n\nOur clients not only get admitted, but many also receive substantial scholarships. Last year our clients received over $11M in merit scholarships.",

      "about": "Livelihood in Change  |  Passionate About Enhancing Personal and Organizational Curiosity for Wisdom and Accountability in Change \n\nTaking responsibility and starting new ventures in today\u2019s volatile, uncertain, innovative and global environment can be hard.\n\nAre you a person who is inspired by opportunities but sense or feel discouraged by uncertainty? Are you ready to partner with the empowering and enabling space of curiosity -the space of not knowing, learning, and making progress - where you are free to re-examine all that you currently know and more, to be present with change, recover quickly from setbacks, and lead with adaptability and imagination? I look forward to meeting with you.\n\nI\u2019m \u015eirin K\u00f6pr\u00fcc\u00fc, The Curiosity Coach. I support organizations and leaders in uncertainty, ambiguity, and innovation. I work with C-suite executives, CEOs, start-up founders, and emerging transformational talent who choose curiosity over fear and can challenge the status quo to thrive rather than struggle, stagnate, or ignore in today\u2019s fast-paced, ever-evolving global and technological environment.  My clients describe me as a kind coach whose intuition is spot on.\n\nMy passion for and conviction about the power of curiosity comes from a multicultural upbringing, a corporate career in the innovative and global space of  Hoffmann-La Roche and Novartis, and living and working in five countries speaking three languages. I\u2019ve coached leaders worldwide, including through executive programs at the Thunderbird School of Global Management and Stanford Graduate School of Business.  I care deeply about impact and witness influential and impactful leaders when they believe in and practice their curiosity instead of fear or ignorance in the context of an unknown.\n\nCertified as a Professional Co-Active Coach (CPCC) and holding an ACC credential from the ICF, I also bring expertise in Global Mindset\u00ae, GlobeSmart\u00ae, and Quantum Negotiation\u2122.\n\nIn my experience, nothing is too difficult, unimaginable, or impossible when approached with one\u2019s curiosity.\n\nTo enrich leadership and execution:\n\nSchedule an INTRODUCTION TO THE GLOBAL MINDSET if you would like to identify your strengths and development areas in building influence - creating shared value and working well with others unlike you.\n\nSchedule an INTRODUCTION TO QUANTUM NEGOTIATION if you would like to explore the art of getting what you need.\n\nInterested legal professionals can find me on https://www.acc.com/career-coaching with the Association of Corporate Counsel.",

I re-designed the node-local cache architecture to expand to a 2-tier model, with a tenant-wide distributed cache serving as L2, to reduce backend load and serve as a safety net during temporary backend failures. I also optimized partition map refreshes to achieve significant performance improvement, providing higher scalability to a larger number of partitions.\n\nI designed and built a highly async, low-latency FE provider layer for a new high-performance Premium Storage service for IAAS, interfacing between the service and backend layers, achieving significant reduction in most request latencies in FE. You can read about Premium Storage here:\n\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/storage-premium-storage\n\nI also implemented CPU-based request throttling for Premium Storage and added support for load-balancer probes, enabling quick isolation of unhealthy roles and removal from active rotation for debugging without traffic disruption. .\n\nI developed a BVT framework for FE, enabling fluid test case development while granting greater control over requests and responses for each test. The framework enables data-driven testing, and automates test platform detection, configuration selection, test versioning, account management and response parsing, allowing developers to focus on core test case logic.

I believe understanding human behavior is essential in both marketing and HR, allowing me to connect more meaningfully with people and drive positive change in the workplace.\n\nJim Carrey once said, \"You can fail at what you don't want, so you might as well take a chance on doing what you love.\" This inspires me to pursue my passions boldly and embrace risks that align with my goals.\n\nOutside of work, I enjoy spending time with friends and family, attending concerts, reading, and exploring creative outlets that keep me inspired.",

      "about": "Stanford CS |  Musician |  Entrepreneurship\n\nI\u2019ve always found myself drawn to the intersections where ideas collide\u2014whether it\u2019s music and technology, art and business, or creativity and logic. Growing up, my days were split between tinkering with computers and losing myself in music. Fast forward to now, as a Computer Science major at Stanford, I\u2019m still chasing that blend of precision and passion.\n\nOn the technical side, Stanford has been my playground for tackling complex problems\u2014whether it\u2019s writing efficient algorithms, designing systems, or diving deep into the nuances of code. I love the challenge of solving puzzles that push my thinking to new levels.\n\nBut it\u2019s music that keeps me grounded. Playing instruments, composing, or just sitting in on a jam session\u2014music feels like my second language. It\u2019s taught me how to collaborate, listen, and experiment, which I bring into every part of my life, including my work.  \n\nAt the same time, I\u2019ve always had an entrepreneurial itch\u2014the kind that makes me question how things work and imagine how they could be better. Lately, I\u2019ve been drawn to the question: *What does the future of music look like?* Whether it\u2019s building platforms to connect artists, designing tools to simplify the creative process, or finding ways to make the industry more equitable, I want to be a part of shaping what\u2019s next.\n\nRight now, I\u2019m looking for opportunities to bring my skills to meaningful projects\u2014places where technology, creativity, and big ideas intersect. If you\u2019re working on something bold, let\u2019s talk. I\u2019d love to explore how we can build something that matters.\n\nLet's connect and explore how we can combine our passions to create something extraordinary. Reach out to me here or via email at tamish01@stanford.edu. I'm excited to connect with industry professionals, fellow entrepreneurs, and music enthusiasts to forge meaningful collaborations and drive innovation.",

So I entered the tech industry, became a web designer and Internet marketing professional and have done something new every day since. Still, you can expect some common threads to appear when we work together:\n\n- Enthusiasm. Insight. Seeing beyond the immediate problem to the overall puzzle into which it fits.\n\n- Honesty. Optimism. No matter where we are, there is a path that leads upward.\n\n- Experience. Savvy. A few decades have tempered the passions of youth and formed a pragmatic approach for long-term results.\n\nThe status quo is ever my arch-nemesis, which is why even my fiction challenges my characters (and my readers) to shifts in perspective.\n\nCurrently co-running a volunteer-driven publishing company, developing a half-dozen special-interest websites, writing flash fiction and several non-fiction projects. Exploring opportunities to share my skills in new places with other creatives doing great work.",

I'm experienced in designing products that work and scale efficiently across platforms. I like to seed design thinking and product-lead growth in organizations, regardless of their size.\n\nIn 2018 I founded Collective with a mission to redefine the way businesses-of-one work. Collective is backed by General Catalyst, Google's Gradient Ventures, QED, Expa, Ashton Kutcher and more.\n\nIn 2015 I joined the YC startup MBX ($200M in funding) as VP of Product Design. I built and lead a team that designed an end-to-end beauty and e-commerce experience.\n\nIn 2013 I came to the US to help building Udemy (NASDAQ:UDMY), now a public and one of the largest online education platforms with more than 40 million students around the world. \n\nIn 2010 I was the Head of Android Business at Elisa (HEL: ELISA), one of the largest public telecom operators in Finland. During my management, Elisa took over the largest Android market share and pioneered a local mobile ecosystem.\n\nI\u2019ve done notable product and design work at Google Express and Angry Birds, and was listed among \u201c64 people you should know in design\u201d, together with design leaders of Uber, Stripe, Google, Airbnb, Facebook, Slack, Lyft, and Medium.",

      "about": "Hey y'all! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nI\u2019m William, an Atlanta native with a passion for solving real problems for real people through user-centric design.\n\nI\u2019m a 4x founder, industrial designer by trade, early AI adopter, and a learned marketer with 5+ years of startup-building. Before jumping into the entrepreneurial void, I worked as a consultant for Fortune 100 companies and scrappy startups alike, tackling complex challenges across industries. My latest experiment turned product , SuperCopy, was born out of my own marketing agency\u2019s need for better tools to streamline content creation and maintain brand consistency.\n\nAs the co-founder and CEO of SuperCopy, I\u2019m on a mission to create AI solutions that genuinely make life easier for marketing teams. How? By listening \u2013 a lot. I\u2019ve had thousands of conversations with marketers, from solo freelancers to Fortune 500 VPs, to truly understand what they need to succeed.\nI\u2019m not just building AI for the sake of technology \u2013 we\u2019re creating tech that truly understands the \u201cwhy\u201d behind people. My experience as a designer and researcher has taught me that the best solutions come from deeply understanding the people who use them. That belief drives everything that I am doing at Supercopy. Every feature we build is designed to adapt to the unique needs of people, not the other way around. \n\nHere's the million-dollar question I am solving for\u2026 How much time and creative energy could your team reclaim with an AI platform that knows your brand voice AND your audience better than you do? \ud83e\udd14\n\nRemember, assumptions don't build great solutions \u2013 users do. We learned that the hard way (so you don\u2019t have to \ud83d\ude05).\n\nOutside the office, you can find me hunting down Atlanta\u2019s best vegetarian tacos, asking way too many questions, or hiking through a National Park.",

By citizenship, I am Canadian and Latvian. Any kind of war is against my religion, and I can not support any kind of war, military action, or disturbance of peace. I believe that countries and people need to work together to fight diseases and make the world more sustainable.\n\nIn 2014, I founded Insilico Medicine (www.insilico.com) a global clinical-stage generative AI drug discovery. Until 2019, it was an AI-first drug discovery company, with most of the team focused exclusively on developing and applying deep learning methods to drug discovery. Insilico is the original inventor of multiple drug discovery technologies with multiple granted and pending patents in biomarker development and generative chemistry and generative biology. In 2019 the company started working on its own therapeutic programs focusing predominantly on immunology, oncology, fibrosis, and CNS. It also made its industrial-strength target discovery platforms (PandaOmics) and generative chemistry (Chemistry42) platforms available for licensing and partnering. It raised over $500 million from expert healthcare, biotechnology, and technology investors, and entered 2 Phase II clinical trials with the novel target discovered using AI and novel molecule designed using AI. Since 2019, Insilico nominated 22 preclinical candidates, 10 reached clinical stage, 1 completed Phase 2a. \n\nI also founded, co-chair and personally sponsor the largest global non-profit conference on aging research and drug discovery - Aging Research and Drug Discovery (ARDD), www.AgingPharma.org. In 2024, the University of Copenhagen will host 11th annual ARDD - please register early as it usually sells out in advance. \n\nLife positioning statement: \nwww.LongevityPledge.org\n\nPublication record: \nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=zhavoronkov+a \nhttps://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8Icccp0AAAAJ&hl=en\n\nForbes.com articles: \nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/alexzhavoronkov/ \n\nMy book is out in English, Japanese, Chinese, and Polish: \n\"The Ageless Generation: How Advances in Biomedicine Will Transform the Global Economy\", Palgrave Macmillan, NY, 2013\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Ageless-Generation-Biomedicine-Transform/dp/0230342205/\n\nEmail:              alex@insilico.com \nFB:                    /biogerontology\nTwitter:          @biogerontology",

We also discovered several mechanisms driving the aging process and invented interventions targeting these mechanisms. Deep Longevity was incubated by Insilico Medicine to further develop and commercialize these aging clocks and help power the nascent longevity biotechnology industry.   \nDeep Longevity is developing explainable artificial intelligence systems to track the rate of aging at the molecular, cellular, tissue, organ, system, physiological, and psychological levels. It is also developing systems for the emerging field of longevity medicine enabling physicians to make better decisions on the interventions that may slow down, or reverse the aging processes. Deep Longevity developed Longevity as a Service (LaaS)\u00a9 solution to integrate multiple deep biomarkers of aging dubbed \u201cdeep aging clocks\u201d to provide a universal multifactorial measure of human biological age. Originally incubated by Insilico Medicine, Deep Longevity started its independent journey in 2020 after securing a round of funding from the most credible venture capitalists specializing in biotechnology, longevity, and artificial intelligence. ETP Ventures, Human Longevity and Performance Impact Venture Fund, BOLD Capital Partners, Longevity Vision Fund, LongeVC, co-founder of Oculus, Michael Antonov, and other expert AI and biotechnology investors supported the company. Deep Longevity established a research partnership with one of the most prominent longevity organizations, Human Longevity, Inc. to provide a range of aging clocks to the network of advanced physicians and researchers.",

In June, I made the decision to step away from WeWalk and YGA to fully focus on From Your Eyes. Simultaneously, I graduated from Microsoft's Imagine program, providing a solid foundation for our startup's journey.\nWith a clear career development plan in place, we completed From Your Eyes' MVP, accelerated our growth through \u00c7ekirdek and BTM Pre-Incubation programs, and introduced From Your Eyes to its first users. This strategic approach has been one of my most rewarding decisions.\nI am immensely proud of this journey and the person I have become.
