I'm currently exploring new startup opportunities and seeking exceptional cofounders who share my philosophy of building lean, high-impact products.\n\nOn the technical side, people who know me well would say I'm the go-to person for:\n- computer vision & deep learning: formerly top contributor to PyTorch, built & trained SOTA vision models for instance segmentation & document understanding\n- developer libraries: authored several Python libraries that unexpected took off on GitHub - open-source lover here \ud83d\udc4b\n- IoT & visual intelligence: co-founded Pyronear, an NGO using deep learning on Raspberry Pi for wildfire detection\n\nOne thing you should know: my front-end skills are a work-in-progress. Fortunately, I'm a driven learner and Cursor + Claude Sonnet + fancy MCPs are pulling me out of my inexperience.\n\nI'm now actively seeking ambitious cofounders! If you're excited about building something tangible, in-person, and fast, let's talk \ud83e\udd19",

In the following 24 months, we achieved what we hadn't been able to do in the previous 3 years. We grew revenues to over \u00a35million in ARR and now promote card-linked offers to over 105 million payment cards globally, via partnerships with major financial institutions, airlines, employee benefit platforms and reward schemes. \n\nWe are building market-leading rewards scheme technology and solutions. \nB2B focussed. Technology driven. \n\nWe also raised multi-seven-figure investment to fund our growth. \n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nAchievements:\n- RMI 30under30 (Restaurant Marketer & Innovator)\n- Hurun's Future Stars\n- Top 42 entrepreneurs under 42 by Insider SW\n- Multi-seven-figure in equity investment secured throughout the lifetime of the business\n- Top Ten Entrepreneurs to Watch in 2017 by #1 Global University Accelerator, SETsquared\n- Two time Bath Business Plan competition winner & UoB Dragons' Den winner\n- Sparkies Awards: Finalist of the Best App category and James Courtney for FutureSpark award\n- Creative Bath Awards: Finalist in the Best App category and James Courtney for Young Creative\n- Ten months at IBM working on Social Media Analytics & engaging with innovation days\n- Six months at Unilever working on Global Marketing Strategy\n- A summer at PwC as a Management Consultant\n- A year at Filament as an AI Strategist (product mgmt, strategy consulting & marketing)\n- Graduated with a First in BSc.

We promote brands to over 105 million payment cards across the UK and US via partnerships with major airlines, banks, employee benefit platforms, cashback sites and premium rewards schemes. \n\nJames founded LUX whilst completing his Business Management degree at the University of Bath, at the age of 21. Using his experience as a management consultant for IBM and PwC, he spotted a gap in the restaurant promotion market for a premium alternative to discounting. He led the business through multiple equity funding rounds, totalling seven-figures and including investment from JUST EAT Plc.\n\nPost-covid, he pivoted the business into the B2B space. This moved LUX away from being a consumer app and now focusses on working in partnership with major airlines and banks. This strategic shift has transformed the business, with revenue growing by over 100x in a 2 year period.",

The significant success we've witnessed as business in recent months can be attributed in part to his tangible and invaluable inputs.\n\nBeyond his professional prowess, what sets Justas apart is his innate sense of empathy and camaraderie. His ability to discern when a colleague might be going through a tough time, his proactive suggestions for team bonding, and his impeccable timing to bring levity to our work environment speaks volumes of his character. Operating in a role like operations, which at times can be undervalued, Justas has displayed tremendous resilience, growth, and an admirable honesty. His eagerness to learn and develop stands as a testament to his professional commitment.\n\nWhile it's with a heavy heart that we bid farewell to such an integral team member, I'm confident that his journey ahead will be laden with success and accomplishments. Justas, always remember that you have a special place within the LUX family, and our support extends far beyond the confines of the office. Your future endeavours will undoubtedly have us rooting for you, and Visa is indeed fortunate to have someone of your calibre on board.\n\nWishing you the very best in your next chapter, Justas.

Competitors entered a speed dating event to be paired with a business mentor and attended a business dinner hosted by sponsors Deloitte.\n\nThey had the opportunity to pitch their plan to Bath graduates now working as consultants at Deloitte, to receive valuable feedback ahead of the final presentation of their fincancial projections and business and marketing strategies to the panel of judges. \n\nA panel of top business judges were impressed by James\u2019 thorough and detailed plan, and the quality of his presentation. Colin Clarkson-Short, Partner at Deloitte, and Head of Consulting for the South West and Wales, said: \"Deloitte has supported the Business Plan Competition for the last nine years and each year the standard has got better. This year it was hard to separate the four finalists. All had prepared comprehensive viable plans, gave great presentations, and demonstrated a commitment to launch within the next six months. James\u2019 plan just had the edge with the right depth and detail across all the required elements. He is a worthy winner.\"\n\nJames was mentored by Bath and Deloitte alumnus Matt Parfitt, now Senior Accountant \u2013 Employee Taxes at Nationwide, who added: \u201cJames needed very little guidance as he had already done so much work and was so passionate about his idea it that it made my role very easy. I immensely enjoyed teaming up with James - working with someone with such contagious passion for something is a truly inspirational experience.\u201d\"",

It was touching how much a difference we made and how well we managed to integrate with the families there. Following this we successfully completed a five day trek across rain forests and up mountains. Undoubtedly some of the hardest but most rewarding days of my life.\n\nThe expedition had a strong emphasis on personal development and I was frequently given the opportunity to be the day leader. This stretched and improved my leadership skills as I had to motivate a large group of people to work together through some of the most challenging moments of their lives. On top of standard organisation responsibilities such as time keeping, I created and ran 'energisers' (small games) to develop teamwork and coordinated effective reviews so that we could continuously develop the ways in which we worked together. \n\nIf you would like to find out more about my work in Costa Rica, please follow this link:\n\nhttp://www.raleighinternational.org/where-we-work/costa-rica-nicaragua"

It taught women in Greek refugee camps conversational English and computer literacy, providing access to practical skills for refugees out of education due to civil war, preparing them for the job market in their host countries. In one year, I successfully built an enterprise from the ground-up on a shoestring budget, raising over 30,000 euros, learning invaluable insights on self-directed project management, human-centred design, and stakeholder accountability. Here is an interview by a magazine about the project: https://www.erasmusmagazine.nl/en/2018/12/24/this-student-is-creating-a-community-center-in-a-greek-refugee-camp/",

      "about": "As the founder and CEO of a stealth mode startup, I leverage my multidisciplinary background and expertise in new business development to create innovative solutions for the global market. I have over 14 years of experience as an entrepreneur, leading and advising multiple companies across different industries and sectors. My entrepreneurial career began at age 20 when I launched my first company, Fesa Enterprises, a specialty retail company with sixteen mall kiosks along the West Coast. In 2007, I  became managing director and adviser for One Planet Education Network (OPEN), an international educational technology company that brings dynamic learning to students via the Internet. \n\nAt 15, I received a scholarship to attend Bard College at Simon's Rock. Instead, at 16, I  decided to attend law school in Brazil at PUC-Rio. Later, I pursued a double major in Philosophy and Financial Economics with a concentration in Computer Science at Columbia University.",

I realized I had a knack for spotting inefficiencies and solving problems in novel ways.\n\nThat\u2019s why I got into tech, and now I've been working in this industry for over a decade (ok almost 2 decades).\n\nI\u2019ve led 3 successful exits, scaled 3 businesses to $100M ARR, and led teams to develop innovative solutions that save companies millions in operational costs.\n\nToday, I'm building something new (currently in stealth). \n\nFollow my profile if you want to see what's next.\n\nYou\u2019ll also find me here sharing thoughts on startup culture, turnarounds, leadership, and my daily rants about life and business\u2014unfiltered, no fluff, just the hard truths and lessons I\u2019ve learned along the way.\u270c\ufe0f",

Reaching the next level of leadership requires a shift in posture, in decision-making, and, most of all, in choosing to be a linchpin. \nWithout guidance, this process can take years of trial-and-error. The altMBA accelerates this personal and professional transformation by providing a deep view of leadership, organizations, and change.\n\nFollowing a competitive selection process, the altMBA delivers a condensed learning experience through teamwork, personalized feedback, coaching, curated readings, and shipping 13 projects in 4 weeks to take fast-tracked leaders to the next level.",

As his manager I've been working closely with Robin from August 2013 at IASO up till August 2015 at LogicNow. Everywhere he gets his hands on, I can trust will be a massive improvement. Robin has a very strong BS radar and won't hesitate to show how it can be done differently and he will tell you why. Which is a critical attribute if you want to push your organisation forward. From the website UX to on-boarding to creative brand campaigns he can lead a creative UX team by example. He also seeks collaboration when he believes someone else can provide a different perspective. Something that helps the overall result become even better. The challenge that most UX designers have is that most of them can't relate to the business objectives. Robin already took that step how a better UX aligns to the overall business objectives and how to measure that."

My work centers on building scalable, impactful solutions that improve patient outcomes, support healthcare professionals, and modernize the care ecosystem. \n\nMy journey began after seeing the effects of misdiagnosis within my own family, an experience that led to a lifelong mission to make healthcare safer, smarter, and more humane. That mission guided me from founding and selling an AI startup to now shaping strategic growth efforts at the intersection of AI, data, and healthcare innovation.\n\nOur focus is global. Our approach is collaborative. And our vision is bold: a healthcare system where technology works for everyone: patients, providers, and innovators alike. \n\nLet\u2019s connect if you're working on something that can change the world, or if you want to be part of one that is.",

His content was consistently creative, engaging, and effective at driving buzz around our app. But what really stood out was how open Uke was to feedback. Anytime we offered suggestions, he was quick to implement them and find ways to make his work even better.\n\nBeyond this, Uke's positivity had a way of rubbing off on the whole group - he'd constantly be lifting morale and getting everyone hyped up. We all loved working with him."

I have never worked with someone who is able to balance raw creative genius with practical hustle like she has. \n\nClare maintains the ability to come up with extremely creative and groundbreaking ideas, but is able to craft them in a way that is always culturally relevant \u2013 and ahead of cultural trends in many cases. She continues to be the first person I would think of when considering a new concept or revision to the brand. During her time with Moment, this manifested in the creation of a holistic brand identity \u2013 which was ultimately translated into a set of cohesive social media, email, and SMS marketing campaigns. This drove revenue significantly, and has been a long term asset for the brand as we\u2019ve grown.\n\nShe demonstrated true entrepreneurial hustle and we could always count on her to get it done. Implementing multiple one-of-a-kind campaigns with mid-sized and micro-influencers (over a short period of time and with a limited budget) is a tough feat, but she was able to execute these is a phenomenal way. \n\nI hope to find many more opportunities to work with her in the future."

Ultimately it lead to the launch of Trifecta via the partnership with The Paleo Diet.

Our solution, the SmartTurn, increases the visibility and control of inventory. With SmartTurn, DiCentral is best fit for companies looking to better manager their supply chain operations, regardless of size and level of complexity.\n\nDesigned for quick implementation, ease-of-use, and real-time inventory accuracy, the SmartTurn solution is a true, multi-tenant WMS delivered via the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model. The system provides immediate information on the quantity, location, and status of every inventory item at anytime, anywhere, eliminating costly paperwork errors and streamlining operations. From multiple warehouse locations to individual stockrooms, we help companies maintain a competitive advantage by reducing inventory costs, improving productivity, and increasing customer satisfaction.\n\nSmartTurn was originally founded in 2004 as a division of Navis LLC. Navis is the world-wide leading provider of logistics systems for marine container terminal management, yard management, and logistics asset management systems. While working with Navis customers such as AP Moeller Terminals, Dubai Ports World, Wal-Mart, Coca Cola Bottling, Johnson & Johnson, PepBoys and other leading supply chain companies, it became apparent that vast number of small and medium sized companies who co-exist or partner in the global supply chain with these major players were in need of a system that addressed their needs. From this observation, SmartTurn was born with the mission of providing an inventory and warehouse management system that fit the requirements of the small to medium supply chain player, delivered it within a cost and risk profile which matches their world, yet still has the flexibility, functionality and power to address even large high volume facilities.",

We then built out TI's on over 30,000 sq. ft. of space across 3 floors and will be expanding to a 4th floor soon. Ron lead all the negotiations, and was able to get more TI covered by the landlord, and even helped with a search for a warehouse space for us in Vegas. He knows the Sacramento market better than anyone I've met, and understands business better than any commercial real estate broker I've met, including other market bosses. \n\nSolid 11/10 would recommend.

They are also going through enormous change and battling with fundamental issues related to housing, transportation, urban planning, the environment, safety, transparency and more. Innovation offers the promise of exciting solutions. But for that change to happen, it must serve the interests of the people who live in cities and overcome the challenges of politics and policymaking. \n\nOur course focuses on this intersection. We analyze cities as a distinct phenomenon, look at what is possible technologically, and explore how change can be brought about.

As we build momentum in artificial intelligence, in distributed trust and in scaled automation, it becomes all the more important to bring new and diverse voices to the table.\n\nLook around. If your company isn't led as much by inclusion as it is by the bottom line, then it will fail at both.\n\nThis isn't a traditional LinkedIn bio. I get that. But if people who look like me don't *start* this conversation, I don't know who else will. \n\nLet's change the world together. ",

Her reputation preceded her - and when I finally met her I didn't know what to expect but I certainly didn't expect someone so humble and thoughtful. It's hard to find that at startups. \n\nLynze was both a genius at sales and a genius at managing people. When Sprinklr acquired my company, she was one of the people who made that possible at all - from onboarding to higher-level syncing of company culture. It was no surprise what happened next - from Sprinklr becoming a unicorn to Lynze moving beyond to follow her own passions. \n\nIt's no wonder she's so successful at connecting people to what makes them great. Lynze's superppower is seeing through a mess of bureaucracy or lingo or half-baked ideas into what's great - be that about a product or about an opportunity or most importantly about a person. She's smart as heck and more importantly she's always going to get things done. "

My journey began in data science, where I worked on special projects for organizations such as ExxonMobil, Google, Apple, the Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC), and the United States Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). These experiences provided me with a solid foundation in data analysis and technology development.\n\nPrior to establishing Xenesis, I worked at the Official Airline Guide, focusing on commercializing global aviation datasets. During this time, I envisioned a global flight tracking solution that utilized satellite technology to modernize flight tracking systems. Recognizing the critical nature and volume of data involved, I shifted my focus from data creation to developing the world's first commercial optical data transport provider. This led to the founding of Xenesis, where we pioneered the delivery of a global optical multilayered mesh network system. Having exited Xenesis ... I am pursuing new passions in data and Team building.\n\nGeneral Skills : Strategic Pursuit Leader, Pursuit Strategy / Win Strategy, Complex deal pursuit, Enterprise sales, IT services industry, Consulting sales, High-value proposals, Client Growth, , Business and Technology Consulting, Solution Design and Orchestration, Customer Relationship Management, Cross-Functional Collaboration, First Principles\n\nExperience : Strategic Account Engagement, Value Proposition Development, Stakeholder Alignment, Deal Shaping and Execution, Competitive Landscape Analysis, Client Engagement and Relationship Management, Complex Sales Cycle Management, Multi-Solution Integration, Technology Transformation, Business Outcome-Driven Solutions\n\nTechnology & Industry Knowledge : Cloud computing, Data analytics, Cybersecurity, Network infrastructure, Enterprise Applications, Digital Transformation, Artificial Intelligence (AI) Solutions, Telecommunications, Complex Architectures, Networks, Meshed Networks, RAN/DTN, Hybrid Architectures, ConOps Design\n\nSoft Skills & Leadership : \nCommunication and Presentation\nRelationship-Building with C-suite & Stakeholders\nCollaboration Across Multi-Disciplinary Teams\nFast-paced Dynamic Work Environment Adaptability\nInfluencing & Facilitating Internal & External Alignment",

During another period, I educated other software engineers concerning I18N and worked on internationalizing software at several consecutive software companies (a BIOS developer, a genetic science startup, a company making an Enterprise database abstraction layer, an advisor to 3rd party Bay-Area software developers, a German company developing a time-tracking system, and a few others).\n\nI have also brought three products to market myself (and with some contractors).  I'm currently working on the fourth.product.  I did the Full Stage Life-cycle development, marketing, and sales.\n\nI feel very experienced, because I have seen so much software in different stages of development. I identify design or testing weaknesses, implementation or benchmark issues, and address those problems.  I talk constructively with involved engineers and management, and give good presentations.\n\nI have led several terms, one for NCR Micrographics, and for my own products.\n\nBecause of all of this technical exposure and the skill I've gained in the navigation of people and personalities to accomplish different projects, I am seeking a company which needs an experienced, stabilizing manager to successfully create, finish, and deliver great products, mentor employees, and use appropriate methodologies and metrics.  I am committed to your success.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nPortfolio and some code at MLSchaffer.com  Like all good websites, it is under constant improvement and is a work in progress.",

Also modified the PC software accordingly, and maintained backward compatibility, so \"old\" datasets could be read.

I was the Architect of the user interface of a complex CAD system. I implemented the U/I as a Windows Win32 application. The purpose of the program was to model the magnetic field strength during the design phase by altering the location, size and electrical power characteristics. The program was used with high current devices, like \"high tension\" wires, power substations and electric subways.",

He's had his own tech company, he's been acquired, he's worked at Google, Uber, and Netflix, and he's been a founding UI architect at several startups.  I had the pleasure of working with Mike at Platfora and Uiflow.  One of my fondest memories of Platfora was sitting near Mike in the office - he was absolutely great to be around.  We were always sharing a laugh.  At Uiflow, he has been instrumental in getting our codebase into shape and improving dev workflows and code resiliency.  One of Mike's greatest strengths is that he is constantly up to date on current technology trends and is always looking to improve himself and the technology he is working with.  He's a force to be reckoned with.    "

Dirk\u2019s dedication, expertise, and commitment to our collaborative efforts have been truly exceptional. By initiating a methodical process to align our respective organizations\u2019 mutual goals, Dirk has had a fundamental impact on the outcome of this fantastic partnership. \n\nBeyond the professional accomplishments, Dirk is such a pleasure to work with on a personal level. Dirk is approachable, collaborative, yet he doesn\u2019t compromise on quality and gives direct feedback, which is crucial for our organization ability to learn and improve. \n\nDirk's demeanor, exceptional communication skills, and diplomatic approach in navigating diverse cultures have effectively facilitated smooth interactions between our teams. This has guaranteed alignment with our shared objectives, yielding both tangible business results and the cultivation of a culture grounded in trust and cooperation between our respective companies.\n\nDuring my tenure working with close to 100 partners, thanks to Dirk's leadership, Adyen was easily in our short list of top valuable partners, and not because of its check size (we have some room to grow there \ud83d\ude09) but due to its insistence to make us better."

From the start, Rikin was incredibly transparent about the expectations of the role and the future direction of the company. He openly discussed where the team currently faces challenges and how my role would be instrumental in tightening processes and driving improvement. I really appreciated his straightforward and honest approach\u2014there were no vague answers or sugar-coating. \n\nWhat stood out most was Rikin\u2019s clear vision for the company and his ability to communicate that vision in a way that inspires confidence and excitement. His candid insights into the team\u2019s areas for growth gave me a real sense of the impact I could make and where I could bring value. It\u2019s rare to find someone who is not only focused on success but also genuinely invested in building a better team and product.\n\nOverall, the experience left a lasting impression. I would highly recommend working with Rikin for anyone looking to be part of a dynamic, evolving company under a leader who values transparency and collaboration."

I'm experienced in designing products that work and scale efficiently across platforms. I like to seed design thinking and product-lead growth in organizations, regardless of their size.\n\nIn 2018 I founded Collective with a mission to redefine the way businesses-of-one work. Collective is backed by General Catalyst, Google's Gradient Ventures, QED, Expa, Ashton Kutcher and more.\n\nIn 2015 I joined the YC startup MBX ($200M in funding) as VP of Product Design. I built and lead a team that designed an end-to-end beauty and e-commerce experience.\n\nIn 2013 I came to the US to help building Udemy (NASDAQ:UDMY), now a public and one of the largest online education platforms with more than 40 million students around the world. \n\nIn 2010 I was the Head of Android Business at Elisa (HEL: ELISA), one of the largest public telecom operators in Finland. During my management, Elisa took over the largest Android market share and pioneered a local mobile ecosystem.\n\nI\u2019ve done notable product and design work at Google Express and Angry Birds, and was listed among \u201c64 people you should know in design\u201d, together with design leaders of Uber, Stripe, Google, Airbnb, Facebook, Slack, Lyft, and Medium.",

      "about": "My posts and articles here are strictly personal, not reflective of positions or policies of Insilico Medicine, which disclaims any responsibility for my individual statements.\n\nI am also 100% focused on extending healthy, productive life for everyone on the planet. By citizenship, I am Canadian and Latvian. Any kind of war is against my religion, and I can not support any kind of war, military action, or disturbance of peace. I believe that countries and people need to work together to fight diseases and make the world more sustainable.\n\nIn 2014, I founded Insilico Medicine (www.insilico.com) a global clinical-stage generative AI drug discovery. Until 2019, it was an AI-first drug discovery company, with most of the team focused exclusively on developing and applying deep learning methods to drug discovery. Insilico is the original inventor of multiple drug discovery technologies with multiple granted and pending patents in biomarker development and generative chemistry and generative biology. In 2019 the company started working on its own therapeutic programs focusing predominantly on immunology, oncology, fibrosis, and CNS. It also made its industrial-strength target discovery platforms (PandaOmics) and generative chemistry (Chemistry42) platforms available for licensing and partnering. It raised over $500 million from expert healthcare, biotechnology, and technology investors, and entered 2 Phase II clinical trials with the novel target discovered using AI and novel molecule designed using AI. Since 2019, Insilico nominated 22 preclinical candidates, 10 reached clinical stage, 1 completed Phase 2a. \n\nI also founded, co-chair and personally sponsor the largest global non-profit conference on aging research and drug discovery - Aging Research and Drug Discovery (ARDD), www.AgingPharma.org. In 2024, the University of Copenhagen will host 11th annual ARDD - please register early as it usually sells out in advance. \n\nLife positioning statement: \nwww.LongevityPledge.org\n\nPublication record: \nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=zhavoronkov+a \nhttps://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8Icccp0AAAAJ&hl=en\n\nForbes.com articles: \nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/alexzhavoronkov/ \n\nMy book is out in English, Japanese, Chinese, and Polish: \n\"The Ageless Generation: How Advances in Biomedicine Will Transform the Global Economy\", Palgrave Macmillan, NY, 2013\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Ageless-Generation-Biomedicine-Transform/dp/0230342205/\n\nEmail:              alex@insilico.com \nFB:                    /biogerontology\nTwitter:          @biogerontology",

        "description": "At Insilico Medicine I invented and co-invented a range of biomarkers of aging and longevity utilizing modern artificial intelligence techniques, published seminal papers, and filed for patents some of which were granted. We also discovered several mechanisms driving the aging process and invented interventions targeting these mechanisms. Deep Longevity was incubated by Insilico Medicine to further develop and commercialize these aging clocks and help power the nascent longevity biotechnology industry.   \nDeep Longevity is developing explainable artificial intelligence systems to track the rate of aging at the molecular, cellular, tissue, organ, system, physiological, and psychological levels. It is also developing systems for the emerging field of longevity medicine enabling physicians to make better decisions on the interventions that may slow down, or reverse the aging processes. Deep Longevity developed Longevity as a Service (LaaS)\u00a9 solution to integrate multiple deep biomarkers of aging dubbed \u201cdeep aging clocks\u201d to provide a universal multifactorial measure of human biological age. Originally incubated by Insilico Medicine, Deep Longevity started its independent journey in 2020 after securing a round of funding from the most credible venture capitalists specializing in biotechnology, longevity, and artificial intelligence. ETP Ventures, Human Longevity and Performance Impact Venture Fund, BOLD Capital Partners, Longevity Vision Fund, LongeVC, co-founder of Oculus, Michael Antonov, and other expert AI and biotechnology investors supported the company. Deep Longevity established a research partnership with one of the most prominent longevity organizations, Human Longevity, Inc. to provide a range of aging clocks to the network of advanced physicians and researchers.",
