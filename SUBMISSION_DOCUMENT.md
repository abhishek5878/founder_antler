## Task 2: Stealth Founder Sourcing & Scoring Framework

### 1. Rationale

Early-stage investing relies on spotting promising founders before they are visible to the wider market. Existing discovery tools are noisy and reactive. This framework is **designed for precision**: systematically identifying, validating, and prioritizing stealth founders with a repeatable and evidence-based process.

### 2. Sourcing Funnel

1. **Discover** â€“ Use LinkedIn queries and open web signals.
2. **Enrich** â€“ Add context from Crunchbase, GitHub, news, hiring pages.
3. **Verify** â€“ Confirm identity, eliminate duplicates, assess confidence.
4. **Score** â€“ Apply structured scoring on team, market, traction, timing, and actionability.
5. **Prioritize** â€“ Tier candidates into A (outreach), B (monitor), C/D (archive).
6. **Outreach** â€“ Run structured, value-first engagement.
7. **Iterate** â€“ Refine based on conversion data.

### 3. Data Schema

| Field | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name | Full name | Prashant Kumar |
| LinkedIn URL | Primary reference | linkedin.com/in/pskumar2018 |
| Role | Current position | Founder, Stealth AI Startup |
| Company/Project | Current venture | "Stealth mode" |
| Location | Geography | Cambridge, US |
| Experience Summary | 2â€“3 prior relevant roles | Meta, Amazon |
| Education | Highest degree/institution | MBA, The Wharton School |
| Skills | Extracted from profile | AI/ML, Product, Search |
| Signals | Hiring/fundraising posts | "Hiring engineers" |
| Source Confidence | 0â€“1 scale | 0.85 |
| Homonym Risk | Identity confusion probability | 0.1 |
| Stealth Flag | If profile indicates stealth status | TRUE |
| VC Score | Composite 0â€“100 | 87 |
| Tier | Priority level (A/B/C/D) | A |
| Notes | Analyst observations | "Ex-Meta, high potential" |

### 4. Scoring Engine

Founders receive a **VC Score (0â€“100)** across 5 weighted pillars:

- **Team (40%)** â€“ pedigree, network, prior success.
- **Market (25%)** â€“ domain size, founder-market fit.
- **Traction (20%)** â€“ early signals (hiring, pilots, investors).
- **Timing (10%)** â€“ stealth status, market readiness.
- **Actionability (5%)** â€“ accessibility and likelihood of response.

**Adjustments:**

- Confirmed stealth â†’ +15% bonus.
- Weak/uncertain data â†’ proportional discount.

**Tiering:**

- **Tier A (75â€“100):** Immediate outreach.
- **Tier B (60â€“74):** Targeted outreach.
- **Tier C (45â€“59):** Monitor.
- **Tier D (<45):** Archive.

### 5. Outreach Plan

- **Connection Request:** Neutral, no pitch.
- **Message 1:** Personalized, references a specific signal.
- **Follow-up 1 (Day 3):** Add value with an insight or resource.
- **Follow-up 2 (Day 8):** Direct but concise request for a short call.
- **Final Touch (Day 14):** Keep door open for future conversation.

### 6. Pilot Rollout (4 Weeks)

- **Week 1:** Collect 200 profiles, validate 120.
- **Week 2:** Score and shortlist 50 high-potential founders.
- **Week 3:** Outreach to Tier A/B, track responses.
- **Week 4:** Meetings with select founders, recalibrate scoring weights.

**Target Outcomes:**

- â‰¥70% high-confidence validation.
- â‰¥20% Tier A candidates.
- â‰¥15% response rate.
- â‰¥25% conversion from outreach â†’ meeting.

### 7. Risks & Mitigations

- **False identity:** Cross-check with â‰¥2 external sources.
- **Signal noise:** Combine automated scoring with manual analyst review.
- **Compliance:** Avoid scraping private data, adhere to GDPR/CCPA.
- **Bias risk:** Monitor for demographic or geographic overrepresentation.

### 8. Deliverables

- Structured Excel database of profiles.
- Notion workspace with schema and scoring framework.
- Pilot report summarizing outreach, scoring distribution, and learnings.
